# Overview
Layover is a TCP & UDP socket proxy intended to help the following scenarios
a) Debug and log a whily networked application without getting into the weeds with ncat
b) Relaying a port of a non containerized process into a container based network i.e [traefik ❤️](https://github.com/containous/traefik)

### Developers Note 
Please do store logs on a live or production process, you are essentially logging all traffic, most likely unencrypted.
Logging is intended for debug use.
